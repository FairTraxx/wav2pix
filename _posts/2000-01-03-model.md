Our model is divided in three modules trained end-to-end: a speech encoder, a generator network and a discriminator network. We have used [SEGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09452) decoder as the encoder. Besides, both the generator and discriminator modules were inspired by [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05396) network using, however, a Least Squares GAN.

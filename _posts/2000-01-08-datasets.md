When it comes to visual attention there is not always a direct relationship between actions and fixations. For example, a person can easily carry an object in her hand and put it on the table without looking at it.
The daily art of cooking, on the other hand, is a series of object-manipulation tasks that require hand-eye coordination. Actions such as cutting onions or pouring a liquid into a bottle are hard to accomplish without using both hands and eyes in coordination. For that reason, we expect that using the salient maps of the video will bring the model closer to the features that are most intimately linked with the tasks carried out by the subjects during the Epic Kitchens dataset acquisition.

We evaluate the Skip RNN model in a series of tasks: (1) adding task, (2) frequency discrimination task, (3) digit classification, (4) sentiment analysis, and (5) action recognition. Please see the [paper](https://github.com/imatge-upc/skiprnn-2017-telecombcn/raw/master/paper.pdf) for results and discussion.
